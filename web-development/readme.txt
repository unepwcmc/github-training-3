The background image is too bright to read the text easily and the client wants a neater font.

Go to styles.css in this folder and edit it using TextEdit, Notepad or another text editor:

1) Change the opactity (line 18) to have a value of 0.7 instead of 0.
2) Add a line between lines 2 and 3 and type 'font-family: Helvetica;', not including the quotes.
